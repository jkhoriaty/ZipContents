# ZipContents

A ZIP archive browser for Sublime Text 3 that supports file and folder exclude patterns.


## Installation

Install with [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io) or download the latest
`ZipContents.sublime-package` file from the [Releases
page](https://github.com/mawelborn/ZipContents/releases) and place it in Sublime Text's
`<data_path>/Installed Packages/` directory.


## Configuration

Navigate to `Preferences`->`Package Settings`->`ZipContents`->`Edit Settings` to configure file and
folder exclude patterns.


## Usage

Open a ZIP archive (or other filetype based on ZIP) with Sublime Text. A quick panel will display
the contents of the archive. Select a file to extract and view it.

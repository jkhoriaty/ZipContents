# ZipContents

A Sublime Text 3 plugin for browsing and viewing the contents of zip archives.


## Installation

Install with [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io) or download the latest
`ZipContents.sublime-package` file from the [Releases
page](https://github.com/mawelborn/ZipContents/releases) and place it in Sublime Text's
`<data_path>/Installed Packages/` directory.


## Usage

Open a zip archive (or other filetype based on zip) with Sublime Text. A quick panel will display
the contents of the archive. Select a file to extract it to a temporary directory and open it in
place of the zip file. Extracted files are automatically cleaned up when Sublime Text closes.

Version 2.0.0

Completely rewritten to reduce file IO, match Sublime Text's Go To Anything behavior,
and filter out irrelevant contents via file and folder exclude patterns:

- Use a fast file signature check in place of ZIP structure check.
- Reuse the hex representation from Sublime Text in place of file reads.
- Use a TemporaryFile for immediate cleanup of extracted files.
- Display contents in a flat list to match Sublime Text's Go To Anything behavior.
- Support file and folder exclude patterns via a settings file.
